Agriculture Management System

Introduction

Background: The Crop Recommendation System is an innovative solution designed to
support agricultural stakeholders by optimizing crop selection processes. Using
data-driven insights, it aids farmers in maximizing yield and efficiency.

System Overview: The system integrates a multi-tiered user framework comprising
System Admins, Enterprise Owners, Employees, and Customers, each with distinct roles
and functionalities.

System Administration

Admin Login Process: The administrative login incorporates advanced security
measures, including password hashing. A 'show password' feature enhances usability,
allowing admins to toggle the visibility of their secure credentials.

System Admin Responsibilities:

Manage Network: Admins can establish and administer network zones, essential for
defining operational areas like Boston, Florida, and Miami, reflecting the system’s
nationwide reach.

Manage Enterprise: A utility to register and categorize enterprises by name, network
affiliation, and enterprise type, complete with a database-supported table view for
organizational clarity.

Manage Enterprise Admin: Facilitates the creation of enterprise-specific admin roles,
allowing for the assignment of usernames and passwords, which are cataloged in a
user-friendly interface.

Enterprise Owner Functionality

Manage Organization: Owners have the ability to manage four distinct organization
types, enabling a structured hierarchy within the enterprise framework.

Manage Employees: This module allows the association of employees with specific
organizations, supporting data entry for names and roles, and reflecting updates in a
dynamically managed table.

Manage User: Here, enterprise owners can generate and assign login credentials to
users, effectively integrating them into the system based on their organizational role.
User Role Functionality

Customer Role:

Request Yield: Customers interact with a form to request specific crop yields, detailing
crop types and quantities, which are then relayed to the warehouse for processing.
Review Yield: Post-request, customers can submit reviews, which are subject to
approval processes managed by warehouse owners for quality control.

Farmer Role:
Add Produce and Request Raw Materials: Farmers can list their produce and request
necessary materials, with an 'Add Produce' feature that updates inventory details for
warehouse management review.

Farmer Assistance: A predictive tool offering weather forecasts to support agricultural
planning, tailored to specific crops and regional conditions.

Warehouse Manager Role:

Yield Inventory Management: This portal presents a comprehensive view of yields,
equipping managers with the necessary data to allocate resources efficiently.

Office Staff Role:
Request Management: Staff are equipped to oversee requests across the enterprise,
ensuring they are directed to the appropriate departments for action.
Reviews and Inventory Access: Access to this module allows staff to monitor feedback
from both farmers and customers, alongside inventory statistics, to maintain service
quality.

Demand and Review Analysis

Farmer Reviews: A feedback system capturing farmers’ evaluations of suppliers,
focusing on quality and shelf life, which informs procurement decisions.

Customer Reviews: An analysis interface where customer feedback on crops is
aggregated, providing insights into farmer performance and product satisfaction.
Demand Analysis Charts: Data visualization tools, including bar and line charts, offer a
graphical representation of demand trends, supporting strategic planning.
